WARNING
===============

> **Notice:** *The classical python "Docker Registry" is deprecated, in favor of a new golang implementation. This here is kept for historical purpose, and will not receive any significant work/love any more.  You should head to [the landing page of the new registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry) or  [the "Distribution" github project](https://github.com/docker/distribution) instead.*

Description
===========

This cookbook deployes the dotCloud [docker-registry](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-registry)

Requirements
============

Chef 0.10.0 or higher required (for Chef environment use).

Cookbooks
---------

* application_nginx
* application_python

Platform
--------

* Ubuntu
* SmartOS
* CentOS (Requires supervisor cookbook >= 0.4.11)

Attributes
==========

See `attributes/default.rb` for default values.

* `node["docker-registry"]["revision"]` - Git tag to install.
* `node["docker-registry"]["storage"]` - Defines the type of storage to use, local or s3.
* `node["docker-registry"]["ssl"]` - If ssl should be enabled.
* `node["docker-registry"]["server_name"]` - The FQDN that NGiNX will proxy for.
* `node["docker-registry"]["data_bag"]` - Name of data bag containing encrypted secrets.
* `node["docker-registry"]["s3_access_key"]` - Your S3 Access Key.
* `node["docker-registry"]["s3_bucket"]` - Your S3 storage bucket.
* `node["docker-registry"]["secret_key"]` - A 64 character random string. This is used to secure the session cookie. It is recommended to store this in the encrypted data bag.

Data Bag
==========

To enable SSL or use S3 as a storage backend a data bag must be created to store the secrets. The data bag should contain an item for each environment that will host the `docker-registry`.

    $ knife data bag show BAG_NAME ENVIRONMENT --secret-file=my-secret-file
    {
      "id": "ENVIRONMENT",
      "secret_key": "...",
      "ssl_certificate": [
        "....", # SSL Certificate Chain
        "....",
        "...." 
      ],
      "ssl_certificate_key": "...",
      "s3_secret_key": "..."
    }

The `ssl_certificate` should contain the entire Certificate chain starting with the server certificate. The values should not contain any new lines. You can do this with `cat my_cert.crt | tr -d '\r\n'`.

Roles
=====

docker-registry
---------------

A helper role that will configure a server to act as both an application server and load balancer.


docker-registry_application-server
----------------------------------

Applying this role will install the docker-registry


docker-registry_load_balancer
-----------------------------

Applying this role will install and configure NGiNX to proxy to all application servers.

The docker-registry_load_balancer role included in the repo will install the latest NGiNX from source. Ubuntu includes an ancient version that won't work with the registry.
